## JPA CRUD Homework

### Application Overview
This weeks homework is going to perform simple CRUD on a single table database of your choosing.

### Learning Objectives
Below are a list of objectives that we see the JPACrud application reinforcing.

  * Creating a SQL database and subsequent tables.
  * Configuring a JPA project.
  * Mapping _Entities_ to SQL tables.
  * Creating JUnit tests to ensure our JPA mappings are correct.
  * Integrating a Spring MVC project with a JPA project.
  * Performing basic CRUD operations.
  * Deploying an application to AWS

### Project Requirement
You'll push your project to a Github repo named `JPACRUDProject`.  Be sure to include a `README.md` detailing the technologies used as well as the purpose of the application.

  * Your project utilizes a MySQL database to manipulate data. For this project you are only required to have a single table and entity.

  * The MySQL table is mapped to a valid JPA Entity and tested to ensure the mappings are working correctly.

  * A Spring project allows for a user to perform basic CRUD operations on your entity via a web interface.

  * Your project and database are deployed to your AWS instance.

### Stretch Goals
Try as many of these as you like, but ONLY after you've completed, tested, and COMMITTED your working application that meets the requirements.

  * Perform CRUD operations on more that one entity. We will learn about relationships and joining tables with JPA next week so for now you will not be able to handle foreign key relationships.
