## JPA C.R.U.D. Project - Grocery List

### Week 9 Weekend Project at Skill Distillery

Built by Vinton Lee for this [assignment](https://github.com/vintonl/JPACRUDProject/blob/master/Assignment.md).

### Overview:

This program is designed to a be website application that creates, reads, updates and deletes grocery list data from a database using Java Database Connectivity.

### How to run:

First, the user enters the index page. The user can choose to:
1. Search the list using a keyword or phrase searching the item name, description, or store.
2. Add an item.
3. Mark item as purchased.
4. Edit an item.
5. See the item details.
6. Delete an item from the purchased list.

The website application will then start the search process of the database and return the result of the search with all of the list data. The user will then have the option to either update the film's attributes, delete the film from the database, or return to the index page.

### Technologies used:

Java, Java Persistence API, Spring MVC & STS, Gradle, SQL, MySQL Workbench, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Apache, Tomcat, AWS, Atom, Git, and Github.

### Topics implemented:

Dynamic Web Applications using Spring MVC.

Tomcat8 on AWS EC2 Instance.

JSP Standard Tag Library to generate HTML.

CCS and Bootstrap to make it web and mobile-friendly.

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).

Relational Databases: SQL Database creation using MySQL Workbench.

Java Libraries: SQL, List, and handling exceptions.

Object-Oriented Programming in Java: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.

Test Driven Development using JUNIT Juniper.

### Lessons learned:

This project helped us better grasp the capabilities of Dynamic Web Applications by allowing us to better learn how to:
1. Build a database using MySQL Workbench.
2. Understand Spring Application Contexts.
3. Use the Java Persistence API to generate HTML.
4. Build a Dynamic Web Applications using Spring MVC.

### Stretch Goals
* CCS and Bootstrap to make it web and mobile-friendly.
